## 📌 How to Use
### 1️⃣ Deploy the API
Ensure you have an API compatible with `/api/v2/hianime/episode/sources`. You can use a modified version of [aniwatch-api](https://github.com/ghoshRitesh12/aniwatch-api) that aligns with this endpoint.

### 2️⃣ Configure the API URL
Modify `player.php` to set your API URL:
```php
$myapi_url = "https://your-api-here.vercel.app";
```

### 3️⃣ Host the Player
Upload the files to a PHP-enabled server such as XAMPP, a shared hosting service, or a VPS.

### 4️⃣ Access the Player
Use the following URL structure to access the player:
```
http://your-site.com/player.php?id=<animeEpisodeId>&server=hd-1&category=sub
```

## 🔍 How It Works (For Beginners)
This PHP script functions as follows:
1. Extracts the episode ID from the URL (e.g., `jujutsu-kaisen-2nd-season-18413?ep=102662`).
2. Fetches video sources from the API (`https://your-api.vercel.app/api/v2/hianime/episode/sources`).
3. Renders the video player using Vidstack, including subtitles and skip buttons.

**New to PHP?** Just upload `player.php` to a PHP-supported server, set your API URL, and open the page in a browser with an episode ID. 🎉
